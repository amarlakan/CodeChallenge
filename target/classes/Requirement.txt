What We're Looking For
What's your style? How do you approach this project? Expect that the initial interview will involve talking about the choices you made.
How do you want the output to look - if you have a lot of time and want to show off your reporting skills, feel free to do so. Have less time? Print out the data/results that we are looking for directly to the console and indicate whether your tests were successful or not - this isn't about scoring bonus points with us, it's about showing us you know the bare minimum and giving us something to chat about during the subsequent interview.
 
How long will this take - that totally depends on you. We think an estimate for something like above will be about 45 - 60 minutes. Doing above and beyond is on you.
If you have questions - please feel free to reach out to us through the recruiter and ask! We're a collaborative team and would be happy to discuss the challenge and clarify anything for you.
